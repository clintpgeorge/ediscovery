Python implementation of Radial Basis Function Networks.
This package aims to provide a numpy implementation of RBFN in python.

Currently you can import an RBFN from Matlab(R) Neural Network Toolbox(TM) and
run it in python. You can use the mlab.export_code to generate the matlab export
script and then use mlab.load to load to run the exported network.

Also you can train your own network using the following functions:

train_exact - Build an exact RBFN from a given Input-Output set.
train_ols - Build an RBFN according to the OLS Algorithm.
